<h1>iPad Pro 10.5&quot; Review (2017)</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The iPP came out a few weeks ago, and I was the first to get one. Here is my review and thoughts.</p>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<h4>Portability</h4>

<p>While the ten-and-a-half-inch is a little bigger than the nine-point-seven, the bezels are much thinner and the difference in size, once the device is in the user&#8217;s hands, is unnoticeable. What&#8217;s more, there&#8217;s no difference in weight- that also helps.</p>

<h4>Screen</h4>

<p>The screen is the main interface of any iPad. From 2010&#8217;s original device, it was very important for Jony to have the iPad sport the best display possible. In the 10.5 inch Pro, that is taken further with a new technology called ProMotion. ProMotion allows the display to refresh at 120Hz versus the previous 60Hz. In the most basic sense, everything is now more fluid. The first time I used the 10.5&quot;, I almost could not believe it. You really have to try it for </p>

<p><em>As usual, the display is Retina, True Tone and P3.</em></p>

<h4>Chip</h4>

<h4>Touch ID 2.0</h4>

<h4>Camera</h4>

<h4>Apps</h4>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<h4>View Controller</h4>

<h4>No Instagram App</h4>

<p>Instagram was always phone-first, and the concept of photos as little digital polaroids will be killed if transferred to the large screen of the iPad</p>

<h4>Some apps yet to support Split View</h4>

<h3>Replacement for Mac</h3>

<h4>Smart Keyboard</h4>

<h4>Great Apps</h4>

<h3>iOS 11</h3>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In general, the iPad Pro is the best computer I&#8217;ve ever used, and I&#8217;ve used MacBook Airs, Pros and just MacBooks for a long time now. The iPad has a great screen, a selection of easy-to-use, yet still powerful applications while still keeping its fundamental pro- it is an iPad and is familiar to almost everyone on this planet. Personally, I will recommend this computer to everyone who requires a lightweight, powerful and easy-going machine.</p>

<p><em>What is really remarkable about the Pro is that it is a diverse computer- on one hand you have Viticci doing power user stuff like complex workflows and coding, and on the other your average granny browsing Facebook, yet they are both satisfied with their choice of machine.</em></p>

<h4>P.P.S.</h4>

<p>I wrote this piece in the back of a Mercedes E-Class on the iPad Pro 10.5&quot; using Workflowy and iA Writer in half-sized split view.</p>
