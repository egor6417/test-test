<h1>iPad Pro 10.5&quot; Review (2017)</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The iPP came out a few weeks ago, and I was the first to get one. Here is my review and thoughts.</p>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<h4>Portability</h4>

<p>While the ten-and-a-half-inch is a little bigger than the nine-point-seven, the bezels are much thinner and the difference in size, once the device is in the user&#8217;s hands, is unnoticeable. What&#8217;s more, there&#8217;s no difference in weight- that also helps.</p>

<h4>Screen</h4>

<p>The screen is the main interface of any iPad. From 2010&#8217;s original device, it was very important for Jony to have the iPad sport the best display possible. In the 10.5 inch Pro, that is taken further with a new technology called ProMotion. ProMotion allows the display to refresh at 120Hz versus the previous 60Hz. In the most basic sense, everything is now more fluid. The first time I used the 10.5&quot;, I almost could not believe it. You really have to try it for yourself.</p>

<p><em>As usual, the display is Retina, True Tone and P3.</em></p>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<h3>Replacement for Mac</h3>

<h3>iOS 11</h3>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<h4>P.S.</h4>

<p>I wrote this piece in the back of a Mercedes E-Class on the iPad Pro 10.5&quot; using Workflowy and iA Writer in half-sized split view.</p>
